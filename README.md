Primary focus of this project was
on forecasting the salaries of data professionals and provide in-depth analysis of employees working in various data professions. 
The variability in salaries within the data profession sector is influenced by factors like experience, job roles, and their performance.
Here I created a ML Model using Pickle and API web application using Flask.
